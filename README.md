# Java Programming Assignments: Strings and Arrays

## Overview
This repository contains three assignments focused on strings and arrays in Java. Each assignment has a set of tasks, and the starter code for each assignment is provided in separate Java files.

- `StringOperations.java`: Starter code for Assignment 1.
- `ArrayManipulation.java`: Starter code for Assignment 2.
- `MatrixOperations.java`: Starter code for Assignment 3.

You are required to complete the tasks, test your code, and push your changes to the repository.

### **Assignment 1: String Operations**

**Objective:**  
Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of different string methods.

**Tasks:**
1. **Calculate the length of the string**  
   Use the `length()` method to find and print the length of the given string.

2. **Extract a substring from the string**  
   Use the `substring()` method to extract a part of the string and print it.

3. **Concatenate with another string**  
   Use the `concat()` method or the `+` operator to concatenate the string with another string.

4. **Find the character at a specific index**  
   Use the `charAt()` method to find and print the character at a specific index in the string.

**Starter Code File:**  
`Strings.java`

### **Assignment 2: Array Manipulation**

**Objective:**  
Write a Java program that performs various operations on an array.

**Tasks:**
1. **Modify an element in the array**  
   Change the value of an element at a specific index in the array and print the modified array.

2. **Print the entire array**  
   Loop through the array and print each element.

3. **Find the sum of all elements in the array**  
   Calculate the sum of all elements in the array and print the total.

**Starter Code File:**  
`Arrays.java`

### **Assignment 3: Multi-dimensional Array Operations**

**Objective:**  
Work with multi-dimensional arrays to perform matrix operations.

**Tasks:**
1. **Access and print specific elements**  
   Access a specific element in the matrix and print it.

2. **Perform matrix addition**  
   Add two matrices and print the result.

**Starter Code File:**  
`MatrixOperations.java`
